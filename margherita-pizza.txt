Recipe 1: Classic Margherita Pizza

Ingredients:

    1 pizza dough ball (store-bought or homemade)
    1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)
    2 cups fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
    1/4 cup fresh basil leaves
    2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
    Salt and pepper to taste
    Cornmeal or flour (for dusting)

Instructions:

    Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
    On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness.
    Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour.
    Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
    Arrange the mozzarella slices on top of the sauce.
    Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
    Carefully slide the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.
    Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
    Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves.
    Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
