Recipe 2: BBQ Chicken Pizza

Ingredients:

    1 pizza dough ball (store-bought or homemade)
    1/2 cup BBQ sauce
    1 cup cooked chicken breast, shredded
    1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
    1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
    1/2 cup shredded smoked gouda cheese
    1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
    Cornmeal or flour (for dusting)

Instructions:

    Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
    On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness.
    Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour.
    Spread the BBQ sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
    Sprinkle the shredded chicken and sliced red onion evenly over the sauce.
    Top with shredded mozzarella and smoked gouda cheeses.
    Carefully slide the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.
    Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
    Remove from the oven and sprinkle with fresh cilantro.
    Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
