Recipe 3: Veggie Supreme Pizza

Ingredients:

    1 pizza dough ball (store-bought or homemade)
    1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)
    1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
    1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
    1/2 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
    1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
    1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
    1/2 cup sliced black olives
    1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
    1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
    1 tsp dried oregano
    1 tsp dried basil
    Cornmeal or flour (for dusting)

Instructions:

    Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
    On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness.
    Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour.
    Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
    Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheeses evenly over the sauce.
    Arrange the green and red bell peppers, red onion, black olives, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes evenly over the cheese.
    Sprinkle dried oregano and basil over the top.
    Carefully slide the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.
    Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
    Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
